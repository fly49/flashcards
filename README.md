This is my pet-application that allows to create flashcards for leraning words. 
There are some key features:

* Create as many cards as you want, organize them into decks.

* Embedded SuperMemo algo provides efficency in learning words, just checking their translation on the main page.

* Scheduled mailing notifications about cards that were expired and need to be learned.
